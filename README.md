# Visualization_using_histogram
  In this project, Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of data and the feature values of interest are grouped into bins, and the total number of data entries within the bins are counted, and these values represent the count.

## Overview
This project is a data visualization exploration that utilizes histograms to analyze and depict the distribution of data. 
Histograms are a valuable tool for understanding the frequency or density of values within a dataset.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

   Demonstrate the power of histograms in visually representing the distribution of data.
   
   Showcase how histograms can reveal patterns, outliers, and insights within a dataset.
  

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following selection:

1.Code:- The `code` directory contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts used to generate the histograms. These scripts are accompanied by explanations and comments for clarity.

2.Data:- The `data` directory contains sample datasets used in the project. These datasets are provided for practice and demonstration purposes.

3.Visualizations:-The `visualizations` directory holds the generated histograms in various formats (e.g., images or interactive plots).
